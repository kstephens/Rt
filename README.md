Gonna Raytrace Like It's 1991!
==============================

Found this code I wrote back in 1991 on a 3.5" floppy.
A raytracer using the RenderMan shader model.
Does not implement The RenderMan Interface, but I was attempting to do so.
Handles shadows and illuminate(), solar(), illuminance() statements. 
4 random samples per pixel.

     $ make
     $ Rt/t/rttest.t # Generates Rt/t/*.png

A bunch of plastic and reflective Spheres and Cylinders under 3 Pointlights and 1 Distantlight.

1991 - 2013
